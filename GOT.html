<p>Trouble is brewing in Westeros. For the inhabitants of this world, control of the Iron Throne
 holds the lure of great power. But in a land where seasons can last a lifetime, winter 
<br>is coming...and beyond the Great Wall that protects them, a forgotten evil has returned. HBO presents 
<br>this epic series based on the book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin.Game of Thrones <br>
is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an <br>
adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, the first of which is<br>
 A Game of Thrones. The show was shot in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain.<br>
 It premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes <br>

Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble cast and follows<br>
 several story arcs throughout the course of the show. The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven<br>
 Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families either vying to claim the <br>
throne or fighting for independence from whoever sits on it. A second focuses on the last descendant of the<br>
 realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is plotting to return and reclaim the throne.<br>
 The third follows the Night's Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from beyond Westeros's <br>
northern border.
