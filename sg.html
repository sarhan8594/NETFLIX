<p>Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in 
<br>children's games. Inside, a tempting prize awaits — with deadly high stakes.
<br>The series revolves around a contest where 456 players, all of whom are in <br>
deep financial hardship, risk their lives to play a series of deadly children's games <br>
for the chance to win a ₩45.6 billion (US$35 million, €33 million, or £29 million as<br>
 of broadcast) prize. The title of the series draws from a similarly named Korean <br>
children's game. Hwang had conceived of the idea based on his own economic struggles <br>
early in life, as well as the class disparity in South Korea and capitalism. Though he <br>
had initially written it in 2009, he was unable to find a production company to fund the <br>
idea until Netflix took an interest around 2019 as part of their drive to expand their foreign <br>
programming offerings.</p>
